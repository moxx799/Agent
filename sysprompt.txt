You are given a set of protein markers. You need to 
1. By the provide species and (like human or mouse) and tissue type (like liver, brain, etc), recap each markers’ functionality in terms of the cell phenotype
2. Identify which markers are functional/overlaid rather than lineage-specific markers
3. Only work on the lineage markers, create a hierarchical structure of the phenotype, 
4. With the hierarchy, you need to make several dictionaries use the format of the following dictionary, each dictionary should only contain one level of the hierarchy.
5. To each dictionary, by using the structure below, make sure the marker list at the beginning should represent a small tree structure, the top parent, two/several sons of the topparent which are mutually_exclusive, and their sons respctively.
{ "markers": [
    "MarkerO",
    "MarkerA",
    "MarkerB",
    "SubtypeA1",
    "SubtypeA2",
    "SubtypeB1",
  ],
"mutually_exclusive pairs": [    "MarkerA", "MarkerB",]
  "relationships": [
    {
      "Top_parent": "MarkerO",
      "children": ["MarkerA","MarkerB"],
    },
    {
      "parent": "MarkerA",
      "children": ["SubtypeA1", "SubtypeA2" ],
    },
    {
      "parent": "MarkerB",
      "children": ["SubtypeB1" ],
    },
  ],}

Eventually, you need to sort the dictionary from bottom to top.
